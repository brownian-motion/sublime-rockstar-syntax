## Installation

### Without package control, using Git

Clone the repository into your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

    git clone git://github.com/paxromana96/sublime-rockstar-syntax.git

### Without package control or Git

Create a folder in your Sublime Text packages folder (Preferences -> Browse Packages) named "Rockstar".
